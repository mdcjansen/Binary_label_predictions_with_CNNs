# Binary label predictions with CNNs

This repository is archived as of 21/05/2024.
A more organised and updated version can be found [here](https://github.com/mdcjansen/CNN)
Currently this repository will exist as a product of my thesis in addition to keeping the old updates of these scripts visible.

This repository contains a collection of codes that trains CNNs in predicting binary labels from input images,
preprocesses data for training CNNs, and utility scripts that aid in either performing the predictions or preprocessing data.

This repository contains two main directories, which used the initials of the user that has uploaded and edited the code. These
folders can contain duplicate codes, with slight alterations to suit the individuals' use case.
